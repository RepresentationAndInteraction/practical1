# Task 1
## Problem 1
Conflict set: $\{A_1\}$

There are two independent and gates, with all inputs active ($In_1(A_1), In_2(A_1), In_1(A_2), In_2(A_2)$). Both of them have their output inactive ($\lnot Out(A_1), \lnot Out(A_2)$). If you assume that $\lnot Ab(A_1)$, then there is a conflict, because

$\begin{aligned}
	\lnot Ab(A_1) \land In_1(A_1) \land In_2(A_1) &\leftrightarrow Out(A_1)\\
	true \land true \land true &\leftrightarrow false\\
	true &\leftrightarrow false
\end{aligned}$

## Problem 2
Conflict set: $\{A_1, A_2\}$

## Problem 3
Conflict set: $\{A_1, A_2, O_1\}$

# Task 2
## Problem 1
Minimal diagnoses: $\{\{A_1, A_2\}\}$

* $\{A_1, A_2\}$

	This is a diagnose because if we assume that components $A_1, A_2$ are defect, we do not get a conflict set.

		?- problem1(SD, COMP, OBS), tp(SD, COMP, OBS, [a1, a2], CS).
		false.

	The diagnosis is minimal because we cannot remove any components from it, without getting conflict sets.

		?- problem1(SD, COMP, OBS), tp(SD, COMP, OBS, [a1], CS).
		…
		CS = [a2].

		?- problem1(SD, COMP, OBS), tp(SD, COMP, OBS, [a2], CS).
		…
		CS = [a1].


## Problem 2
Minimal diagnoses: $\{\{A_1\}, \{A_2\}\}$

* $\{A_1\}$

	Correct:

		?- problem2(SD, COMP, OBS), tp(SD, COMP, OBS, [a1], CS).
		false.

	Minimal:

		?- problem2(SD, COMP, OBS), tp(SD, COMP, OBS, [], CS).
		…
		CS = [a1, a2]

* $\{A_2\}$

	Correct:

		?- problem2(SD, COMP, OBS), tp(SD, COMP, OBS, [a2], CS).
		false.

	Minimal:

		?- problem2(SD, COMP, OBS), tp(SD, COMP, OBS, [], CS).
		…
		CS = [a1, a2]

## Problem 3
Minimal diagnoses: $\{\{X_1\}, \{X_2, A_2\}, \{X_2, R_1\}\}$

* $\{X_1\}$

	Correct:

		?- fulladder(SD, COMP, OBS), tp(SD, COMP, OBS, [x1], CS).
		false.

	Minimal:

		?- fulladder(SD, COMP, OBS), tp(SD, COMP, OBS, [], CS).
		…
		CS = [a1, x1, a2, r1, x2].


* $\{X_2, A_2\}$

	Correct:

		?- fulladder(SD, COMP, OBS), tp(SD, COMP, OBS, [x2, a2], CS).
		false.

	Minimal:

		?- fulladder(SD, COMP, OBS), tp(SD, COMP, OBS, [x2], CS).
		…
		CS = [a1, x1, a2, r1].

		?- fulladder(SD, COMP, OBS), tp(SD, COMP, OBS, [a2], CS).
		…
		CS = [a1, x1, x2].

* $\{X_2, R_1\}$

	Correct:

		?- fulladder(SD, COMP, OBS), tp(SD, COMP, OBS, [x2, r1], CS).
		false.

	Minimal:

		?- fulladder(SD, COMP, OBS), tp(SD, COMP, OBS, [x2], CS).
		…
		CS = [a1, x1, a2, r1].

		?- fulladder(SD, COMP, OBS), tp(SD, COMP, OBS, [r1], CS).
		…
		CS = [a1, x1, a2, x2].

## Reflection

As far as I can tell my solution has only theoretical limitations. Nodes have an integer ID, so the number of nodes is limited by the bitsize of integers used by the Prolog implementations. There are a few more of these limitations, but they should not matter in practise.

During my testing I never came across a case that could not be solved by my implementation.

My `make_hitting_set_tree` rule is not pure, and because of the side effects it is not idempotent. This is by design, because all trees are saved, and their root IDs are tracked, so that we can look at them afterwards.

	tree_root(N), print_tree(N).

This could also be seen as a limitation though, because calling `make_hitting_set_tree` twice results in two trees being generated, and the trees are not identical, though they are isomorphic, and the diagnoses are always correct.

	?- problem1(SD, COMP, OBS), diagnose(SD, COMP, OBS, Diagnoses).
	…
	Diagnoses = [[a2, a1]].

	?- problem1(SD, COMP, OBS), diagnose(SD, COMP, OBS, Diagnoses).
	…
	Diagnoses = [[a2, a1]].

	?- tree_root(N), print_tree(N).
	Node 3
	        Children: [4]
	        Label: [a1]
	        Hitting Set: []
	Node 4
	        Children: [5]
	        Label: [a2]
	        Hitting Set: [a1]
	Node 5
	        Children: []
	        Label: diagnosis
	        Hitting Set: [a2,a1]
	N = 3 ;
	Node 0
	        Children: [1]
	        Label: [a1]
	        Hitting Set: []
	Node 1
	        Children: [2]
	        Label: [a2]
	        Hitting Set: [a1]
	Node 2
	        Children: []
	        Label: diagnosis
	        Hitting Set: [a2,a1]
	N = 0.

I used `maplist`, and `foldl` where possible. There a number of performance optimizations for these built in function in place, so they are more efficient than manual recursion.

### Problems

The main problem I encountered, was that Prolog is very different from the imperative, and object oriented languages I was used to. I have done some programming in Haskell before and that helped a lot to understand pattern matching, `maplist`, `foldl`, immutability, iteration by recursion, and so on.

Another problem was the documentation, which was sometimes [very lacking](http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=foldl/4), so it was a good thing that I was already familiar with many concepts from functional programming.

### Complexity

The depth of the tree is limited by $|COMP|$. If $COMP = \{A_1, A_2, \dots A_n\}, F = \{\{A_1\}, \{A_2\}, \dots, \{A_n\}\}$, then $HS = \{A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n\}$. Each element in HS corresponds to an edge in the hitting set tree, so the maximum depth is $|COMP| + 1$:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
	scale=2,
	c/.style={circle, draw},
]
	\node[c] at (0, 0) (0) {};
	\node at (0, 1) (1) {\dots};
	\node[c] at (0, 2) (2) {};
	\node[c] at (0, 3) (3) {};
	\draw (0) edge node[fill=white] {$A_n$} (1);
	\draw (1) edge node[fill=white] {$A_2$} (2);
	\draw (2) edge node[fill=white] {$A_1$} (3);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The branching factor depends on the size of sets in $F$. You get the highest number of children for $COMP = \{A_1, A_2, \dots A_n\}, F=\{\{A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n\}\}$, but the the depth in just one:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
	scale=2,
	c/.style={circle, draw},
]
	\node[c] at (2.5, 1) (0) {};
	\foreach \vx in {1, ..., 4} {
		\node[c] at (\vx, 0) (\vx) {};
	}
	\draw (0) edge node[fill=white] {$A_1$} (1);
	\draw (0) edge node[fill=white] {$A_2$} (2);
	\draw (0) edge node[fill=white] {\dots} (3);
	\draw (0) edge node[fill=white] {$A_n$} (4);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

In the worst case the sets in $F$ have many elements, but also $|F|$ is big. Then the depth and branching factors are high, and the algorithm is slow.
